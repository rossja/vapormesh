# Vapor Wave Networks

A fully-functional interactive showcase website for a fictitious tech company designed for demonstration, mockup, training, and research purposes.
The site is hosted at https://vapormesh.net.

## Overview

This project provides a complete web implementation with modern UI components including:

- Interactive card-flip product displays
- Dark/light theme system with localStorage persistence
- Realistic product descriptions and marketing language
- PDF download functionality for product datasheets
- Responsive design for various device sizes

The fictitious company and all associated products are entirely fabricated, making this an ideal resource for UI/UX designers, developers, and researchers looking for realistic but copyright-free content to use in demonstrations, workshops, or training materials.
